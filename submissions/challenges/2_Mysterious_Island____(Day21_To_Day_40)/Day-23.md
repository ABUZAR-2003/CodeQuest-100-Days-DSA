# **Day 23: The Word Collector Challenge** 📚✨

### **📜 The Story Continues...**
Deep in the heart of Mysterious Island, you've discovered an ancient manuscript containing forgotten stories. But there's a problem - all the words are jumbled up!

The AI Guide says:  
*"This manuscript only reveals its secrets to those who can organize words properly. Count each word's frequency to uncover hidden clues!"*

Your mission is to analyze word patterns that will lead you to the next destination.

---

### **🎯 Challenge: Word Frequency Counter**
Write a program that:
1. Takes a sentence/paragraph as input
2. Counts how many times each word appears
3. Displays each word with its frequency count

---

### **🔍 Example Input/Output**

#### **Example 1**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter text: The Glitch is everywhere and the Glitch never sleeps.
```  
**Output:**  
```
the: 2
Glitch: 2
is: 1
everywhere: 1
and: 1
never: 1
sleeps: 1
```

#### **Example 2**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter text: Code is life, and life is beautiful.
```  
**Output:**  
```
Code: 1
is: 2
life: 2
and: 1
beautiful: 1
```

*(Bonus Challenge: Handle punctuation and case sensitivity for more accurate results!)*

### **💡 Pro Tips**
- **Text Processing:**  
  - Convert text to lowercase for consistent counting  
  - Remove punctuation marks if needed  
- **Data Structures:**  
  - Dictionaries/HashMaps work perfectly for frequency counting  
- **Language Features:**  
  - Python: Use `split()` and `collections.Counter`  
  - Java: `HashMap` and `String.split()`  
  - C++: `unordered_map` and string streams

---

### **📝 Your Task**
1. Implement the solution in any language (Python/Java/C++/etc.)
2. Save as: `day23_word_collector.[ext]` (e.g. `day23_word_collector.py`)
3. Push to your GitHub repository

### **🌟 Motivational Thought**
*"Every word tells a story - your code helps uncover hidden patterns in the chaos!"* 🚀

---

### **😄 Coding Humor**
*"Why was the JavaScript developer sad?  
Because he didn't know how to 'null' his feelings!"* 

---

**Solved it?** Prepare for **Day 24** where the mystery deepens!  
*"The island has more secrets waiting to be discovered..."*
