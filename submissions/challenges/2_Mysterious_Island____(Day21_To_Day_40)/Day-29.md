# **Day 29: The Scroll Intersection Challenge** 📜🔍  
*Finding Common Elements in Ancient Texts*

### **📜 The Discovery**
In the island's ancient library, you find two mysterious scrolls with numbered inscriptions.  
The AI Guide explains:  
*"These scrolls contain encoded coordinates. The overlapping numbers reveal the path forward!"*

---

### **🎯 Challenge: Common Elements Finder**
Write a program that:
1. Takes two space-separated lists of integers
2. Identifies all unique common elements
3. Prints them in any order (or "No matches" if none exist)

**Technical Requirements:**
- Handle duplicate values in input lists
- Output each common number only once
- Preserve original data types

---

### **🔍 Example Input/Output**

#### **Case 1: Basic Intersection**  
**Input:**  
```
First list: 1 2 3 4 5  
Second list: 4 5 6 7  
```  
**Output:**  
`Common elements: 4 5`

#### **Case 2: No Matches**  
**Input:**  
```
First list: 10 20 30  
Second list: 5 15 25  
```  
**Output:**  
`No common elements found!`

#### **Case 3: With Duplicates**  
**Input:**  
```
First list: 3 3 6 9  
Second list: 3 9 9 12  
```  
**Output:**  
`Common elements: 3 9`

---

### **💡 Implementation Guide**

**Python (Optimal):**
```python
def find_common():
    list1 = list(map(int, input("First list: ").split()))
    list2 = list(map(int, input("Second list: ").split()))
    common = set(list1) & set(list2)
    print("Common elements:", *common) if common else print("No matches!")
```

**Key Concepts:**
- Set operations for O(1) lookups
- Type conversion for clean input handling
- Asterisk (*) for clean output formatting

**Alternative Approaches:**
- For language without sets: use hash tables
- For memory efficiency: sort and two-pointer technique

### **🌟 Algorithm Insight**
*"Finding common elements is fundamental to database joins, recommendation systems, and cryptography. Master this, and you unlock countless real-world applications!"*

---

### **📝 Your Mission**
1. Implement in any language  
2. Save as: `day29_scroll_intersection.[ext]`  
3. Handle these edge cases:  
   - Empty lists  
   - All elements common  
   - Large inputs (>10,000 elements)  

---

### **😄 Developer Humor**
*"Why did the programmer get excited about empty sets?  
Because they had nothing in common!"*
