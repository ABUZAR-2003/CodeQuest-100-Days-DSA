# **Day 21: The Mysterious Map – Crack the Hidden Pattern!** 🗺️✨

### **📜 The Adventure Continues...**
You’ve arrived on Mysterious Island, where every clue holds a secret.  
Echo whispers:  
*"The island’s true beauty reveals itself only to those who solve its puzzles. You’ve found an ancient map with numbers – uncover their hidden pattern to proceed!"*  

This challenge tests your **logical thinking** and **pattern recognition** skills.

---

### **🎯 Challenge: Pattern Finder**  
Your mission:  
1. **Take a list of integers as input** (the numbers on the map).  
2. **Sum the numbers at even positions** (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...).  
3. **Print the total** – this "Hidden Key" unlocks your path forward!

*Note:*  
- Assume **1-indexed positions** (first element = position 1).

### **🔍 Example Input/Output**

#### **Example 1**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter numbers: 5 8 3 10 2
```  
**Logic:**  
- Even positions: 8 (2nd) + 10 (4th) = 18  
**Output:**  
```
Hidden Key: 18
```

#### **Example 2**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter numbers: 4 7 9 3
```  
**Logic:**  
- Even positions: 7 (2nd) + 3 (4th) = 10  
**Output:**  
```
Hidden Key: 10
```

### **💡 Pro Tips**  
- **Iterate smartly:**  
  - Loop through indices, checking if they’re even (remember: 1-indexed!).  
- **Edge cases matter:**  
  - What if the list has only 1 number? Or all odd-indexed numbers?  

---

### **📝 Your Task**  
- Code your solution in **any language** (Python/C++/Java/etc.).  
- Name your file: `day21_pattern_finder.[ext]` (e.g., `day21_pattern_finder.py`).

### **🌟 Motivational Boost**  
*"Every puzzle has a solution – sometimes you just need to shift your perspective."*

### **😄 Echo’s Coding Joke**  
*"Why do programmers confuse Halloween and Christmas?  
Because Oct 31 == Dec 25!"*
